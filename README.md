## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 14.x or later
- Swift 5.7+
- macOS Ventura or later

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Configure Dropbox API Keys:**

    This project requires Dropbox API credentials to fetch content. The existing keys are for demonstration purposes. You should replace them with your own.

    - Open the file: `Global-Project/ManagementSystemData.swift`
    - Locate the `PhaseFeathersReconsider` struct.
    - Replace the placeholder values for `appkey`, `appSecret`, and `refresh_token` with your own Dropbox App credentials.

    ```swift
    // Global-Project/ManagementSystemData.swift

    struct PhaseFeathersReconsider {
        // ...
        //New drop settings
        static let appkey = "YOUR_APP_KEY"
        static let appSecret = "YOUR_APP_SECRET"
        static let refresh_token = "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
        // ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Open and Run the Project:**
    - Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode.
    - Select your target device or simulator.
    - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run the application.

    The app will start, show a loading screen while fetching initial data from Dropbox, and then navigate to the main menu.
